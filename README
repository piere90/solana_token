# Solana Token Project

This project demonstrates how to create, mint, and transfer a native token on Solana using TypeScript and Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Node.js (to run `ts-node` locally, if necessary)

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## Docker Image Build

Run the following commands to build the Docker image and start the containers:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker-compose build

# Start the Docker containers
docker-compose up -d

# Access the Docker container
docker-compose exec solana-token sh

# Execute the scripts in the container
ts-node keygen.ts

# Note the public key printed by the previous command
# This will be used as RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE in subsequent steps

ts-node airdrop.ts
ts-node spl_init.ts

# Note the mint public key printed by the previous command
# This will be used as YOUR_MINT_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE in subsequent steps

# Edit spl_mint.ts by replacing YOUR_MINT_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE with the mint public key
nano spl_mint.ts

# Execute the spl_mint.ts script
ts-node spl_mint.ts

# Edit spl_transfer.ts by replacing YOUR_MINT_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE with the mint public key
# and RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE with the recipient's public key
nano spl_transfer.ts

# Execute the spl_transfer.ts script
ts-node spl_transfer.ts
